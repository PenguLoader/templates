# plugin-base
This is the simplest plugin base it could be. There is no building step meaning your source code is plugin itself.
Using it as simple as dropping to your plugins/ directory!

This simple base creates a modal window using [RCP](https://pengu.lol/runtime-api/rcp)
which will contain custom assets and CSS.
