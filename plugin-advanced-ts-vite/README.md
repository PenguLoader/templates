## Building
Building is no different to every other bundlers. Just run `npm run build` and it will spit everything in `dist/` folder.

## Hot Module Replacement
Vite stands out with its highly efficient Hot Module Replacement (HMR) feature, which allows for instantaneous updates without full page reloads, greatly enhancing the development experience by making it faster and smoother.
To use HMR, as always, just run `npm run dev`.
